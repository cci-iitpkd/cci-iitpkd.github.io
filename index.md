# Facilities
  - Sensor Design and Development Facility: The facility will be 
used to design, simulate, fabricate and test novel sensing systems 
for computational imaging. The sensors can be novel miniaturized 
ultrasonic, optical, physiological or radio frequency sensors.

  - Computational Software Design Facility: The facility will 
facilitate research, design and development of novel data 
acquisition systems, signal conditioning algorithms, image 
reconstruction and analysis algorithms and computer aided 
diagnostics and prognostics.

  - Accelerated Hardware Facility: The facility will be used to 
accelerate the proposed algorithms using various hardware accelerators 
consisting of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), multi-core 
central processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs) 
resulting in real-time power-area efficient performances. 

# Objectives

  1. To generate and foster interdisciplinary research in niche areas 
of computational imaging systems and to impart new technical or 
translational knowledge by means of innovative methods and systems.

  2. To construct pre-competitive prototypes to show the results of 
applied research and for evaluation of its practical viability. 

  3. To offer expert advice in the different areas of expertise of 
the centre including the sensor design, generation, analysis and 
interpretation of experimental data, processing and analysis 
algorithms and fast efficient computational systems.

  4. To aid in transfer of the knowledge generated in the current 
environment of the centre through regulated channels such as the 
teaching of official courses or through less regulated channels 
such as in-house training.

  5. To attract highly competent researchers to IIT-PKD enabling 
high quality research in computational imaging making it a centre 
of excellence.
