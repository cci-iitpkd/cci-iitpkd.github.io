      " The Center for Computational Imaging (CCI) at IIT Palakkad is an interdisciplinary center that is engaged in pushing the frontiers in all aspects of imaging - sensing and image acquistion, processing and visualization, and acceleration. The center aims to synergize research across several layers of the computational system to identify new opportunities for improvements. \n\n
        The main objectives of the CCI are as follows: \n
        - Foster interdisciplinary research in all areas of computational imaging.\n
        - Construct pre-competitive prototypes and evaluate its practical viability. \n
        - Offer expert advice in the different areas of computational imaging\n
        - Disseminate knowledge in the centre to the community at large. \n"
